Welcome to the documentation for Nfield.Quota. This site aims to quickly get you started creating quota in [Nfield].

Quota in [Nfield] can be defined in the three distinct steps. During these steps the user defines the _quota frame_.
This frame encompasses all the information that can be configured during the setps.

1. Create variables definitions  
Variables describe an aspect of respondent information that also respondents to be grouped. E.g. the 
variable _gender_ contains the values _male_ and _female_. As researchers might be interested in multiple aspects, 
multiple variables can be defined and added to the quota frame. 
2. Structure the variables  
In order to get proper respondent representation, variables can be nested/interlocked. This will allow the 
researcher to set targets for individual subgroups. E.g. 50 _males_ in the region _south_
3. Set targets
Once the variables and strcuture has been setup target for the (sub)groups can set.
