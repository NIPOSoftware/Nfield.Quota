# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Nfield.Quota. This site aims to quickly get you started creating quota in [Nfield].

Quota in [Nfield] can be defined in the three distinct steps. During these steps the user defines the _quota frame_.
This frame encompasses all the information that can be configured during the steps.

1. __Create variables definitions__  
Variables describe an aspect of respondents that allows them to be grouped. E.g. the
variable _gender_ allows respondents to be grouped as either  _male_ or  _female_. As researchers might be interested 
in multiple aspects, multiple variables can be defined and added to the quota frame.
2. __Structure the variables__  
In order to get proper respondent representation, variables can be nested/interlocked. This will allow the 
researcher to set targets for individual subgroups. E.g. 50 _males_ in the region _south_.
3. __Set targets__  
Once the variables and structure have been set up, targets for the (sub)groups can configured.
